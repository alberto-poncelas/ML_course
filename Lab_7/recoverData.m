function X_rec = recoverData(Z, U, K)
%RECOVERDATA Recovers an approximation of the original data when using the 
%projected data
%   X_rec = RECOVERDATA(Z, U, K) recovers an approximation the 
%   original data that has been reduced to K dimensions. It returns the
%   approximate reconstruction in X_rec.

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
X_rec = zeros(size(Z, 1), size(U, 1));

maxu=size(U);
tope=min(K,maxu);

X_rec=U(:,1:tope)*Z';

X_rec=X_rec';
